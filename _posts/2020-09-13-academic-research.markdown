Summary:

- The interactivity and immersion motivates and enhances the learning experience a lot.
- Many of the educational games target children or adolescents.

Summary:

- *Boponoto* is an intelligent sketch education application for language students to learn Teach chinese phonetic script. It demonstrates strong results in understanding and assessing students’ written input.
- The following technologies are shown to have strong potential in language (especially secondary language) education:
  - Handwriting recognition
  - Speech recognition
  - Game-like interaction
- Educational software also impede learning quality in some way.

## Phoneme Recognition

Summary:

- Phoneme recognition plays a dominant part in many applications such as speech recognition, speaker recognition, and pronunciation error detection and correction.
- Phoneme recognition rely largely on context. Recognizing unaccompanied phonemes is challenging to do and often inaccurate.

- **Kim, Y., Franco, H., & Neumeyer, L. (1997). Automatic pronunciation scoring of specific phone segments for language instruction. In Fifth European Conference on Speech Communication and Technology.**

Summary:

- Pronunciation scoring is a relatively dated topic. Nowadays it is already in application. It also has great potential in interactive learning.
- It may be suited for gamification.

## Sketch Recognition

- Taele, P. P. (2011). Freehand sketch recognition for computer-assisted language learning of written east asian languages (Doctoral dissertation, Texas A & M University).
- Dixon, D., Prasad, M., & Hammond, T. (2010, April). iCanDraw: using sketch recognition and corrective feedback to assist a user in drawing human faces. In Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (pp. 897-906).

Summary:

- Sketch recognition is also commonly applied. It is different from character recognition, because it focuses on accuracy of the sketching, so as to be used in education.
- It is often referred to when teaching asian characters interactively.
